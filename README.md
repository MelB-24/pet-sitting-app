### Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

This marketplace website I am building is a Pet Sitting app that allows users to sign up to watch dogs or owners to send their dogs to a sitter. Although there are a few services that allow this, there is not one that is well known and used in Australia. 

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?

The pet business is one of the biggest growing industries in the world, including pet food, grooming, day care and more. There are a few websites such as this overseas however none are that well known in Australia. A website like this could be changed to suit a clients needs including making it into a singular businesses website for doggy day care to allow their clients to book their dogs into day care. A website like this one could become very big in Australia with the ever growing pet industry. 

## Description of your marketplace app (website), including:
- Purpose

The purpose of my website is to allow a person who would like to pet sit dogs sign up to the site to make it very easy for them to find clients. Owners of dogs can also sign up on the website to easily find sitters in their area to send their dogs to. 

- Functionality / features

Features of my website include owners creating their own profile as well as a profile for each of their pets. Owners can view all the sitters that are signed up to the website and in future would like to be able to search via names, area and price. They can view a calender and can start to make a booking via a sitter that they have previously approved to pet-sit. Sitters can view their calender of bookings that their owners have made and choose whether they approve the booking based on availability etc. By not approving a booking, in future I would like to implement an email system that notifies an owner if a sitter cannot approve the booking.
